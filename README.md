## 🧠 About the Project

**Skin Code Pay** is a technological solution that transforms the body into a payment key.

With a simple scan of a personal tattoo (using a camera), the app interprets the visual code to authorize financial transactions via Pix or QR Code — all with **14 layers of security** implemented in the backend.
